Super simple (and fast) Markov chains in Rust.

```rust
use markovish::Chain;

let fortune = r#"
This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System.  If this had been an
actual emergency, do you really think we'd stick around to tell you?
"#;

let chain = Chain::from_text(fortune).unwrap();
let new_fortune = chain.generate_str(&mut rand::thread_rng(), 300);
```

This project is mostly for my personal use in [`pandoras_pot`](https://github.com/ginger51011/pandoras_pot/), but PRs
and issues are welcome.

This crate is aimed to be very simple, and the current aim is to do the following well:

1. Take some input text.
2. Parse it.
3. Generate an infinite string of new text using that.

More information about usage and the like can be found in the [crate docs](https://docs.rs/markovish/latest/markovish/)
and in the [examples](./examples).

If you want to save a chain, you can enable the `serde` feature and serialize it.
