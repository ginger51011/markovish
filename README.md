Super simple (and fast) Markov chains in Rust.

This project is mostly for my personal use in [`pandoras_pot`](https://github.com/ginger51011/pandoras_pot/), but PRs
and issues are welcome.

This crate is aimed to be very simple, and the current aim is to do the following well:

1. Take some input text.
2. Parse it.
3. Generate an infinite string of new text using that.

More information about usage and the like can be found in the crate docs and in the [examples](./examples).
